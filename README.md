# Implementation-of-Amplitude-Modulations-AM-DSB-and-SSB
In this repository, I intend to investigate Conventional Amplitude Modulation, which is the simplest form of amplitude modulation. Then, I will implement Double-Sideband (DSB) and Single-Sideband (SSB) modulations. Finally, we will become familiar with the Hilbert Transform and Envelope Detector.

*The aim of conducting this project is to investigate linear modulations, including DSB, AM, and SSB. In the first section, we delve into AM modulation and examine the modulated signal of a specific message. In the second section, we become acquainted with DSB and SSB modulations, and we also attempt to recover the modulated message signal using a synchronous detector. In the third section, we also get introduced to the Hilbert transform and endeavor to employ it in the envelope detector.*

The completed sections of the project are as follows: (CA2_Matlab_810198369.mlx)

**1- Conventional Amplitude Modulation (AM)**

**2- DSB and SSB Modulation**

**3- Familiarity with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the Position Detector**
