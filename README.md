# Implementation-of-Amplitude-Modulations-AM-DSB-and-SSB-
In this repository, I intend to investigate Conventional Amplitude Modulation, which is the simplest form of amplitude modulation. Then, I will implement Double-Sideband (DSB) and Single-Sideband (SSB) modulations. Finally, we will become familiar with the Hilbert Transform and Envelope Detector.
